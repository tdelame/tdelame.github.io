<p>
I have a strong passion for computer graphics, programming, and solving challenging problems. 
Most of my work focuses on bridging the gap between the general public and computers, by providing intuitive interfaces and real time solutions.
I am also very fond of video games and love to spend time playing them or writing IA for them.

Since december 2016, I work for Mercenaries Engineering in Paris area as a R&D software engineer
on <a href="https://rumba-animation.com/">Rumba</a>, a 3D animation software.
